    "description":"The Minister of Agriculture, Omar Jallow, has said that his ministry and the government will exhaust all measures to make the agricultural sector great again. Speaking to women gardeners on Wednesday at Sukuta during his ministry’s tour to the FASDEP intervention sites and other agricultural related areas, Minister Jallow said his ministry is committed to ensuring that agriculture regains its status as one of the driving forces of the country’s economy. “The sector remains the mainstay of the country’s economy where 70% of our population are actively engaged, thereby contributing 30% of the GDP,” he said. Minister Jallow said his ministry’s decision to reinvent some of the agric sectors which were dormant over the past 22-years is a clear indication that they are determined to change the status quo. “It is time for change. We don’t only need to respond to long-standing issues and challenges, but we must also face newer realities,” he said. He said the government is committed to becoming self-sufficient in food through their proposed agricultural transformation to increase productivity in the sector. “But for us to achieve these, there should be strong frameworks for collaboration and mutual accountability between the government, private sector, development partners and others. We must also get into agriculture and see it as a profitable business venture not a sign of lacking ambition,” he said. While reassuring the women gardeners of his ministry’s unflinching support, minister Jallow said the new government and his ministry will have total shift of paradigm to that of their predecessors. He said under his leadership the ministry will continue to put women at the heart of their intervention agendas.“We will give women all the support they need whenever necessary, because wherever I go, the only people I see in the work force are women. But, I believe it is high time men tighten their belt.” Minister Jallow also promised to immediately give two power tillers to the Sukuta women gardeners. Meanwhile, the minister also visited the multi-million dalasi state-of-the-art Sukuta market to do the official handing-over to two Gambian contractors under the funding of FASDEP.",

    "description":"Former Chief of Defence Staff of the Gambia Armed Forces General Ousman Bargie has claimed that he was on numerous occasions offered money by foreign powers to topple former President Yahya Jammeh during the political impasse. Speaking an exclusive interview with The standard, Bargie said these offers came in foreign currencies and were made by European and African countries. “I was approached about three times and offered money in cartons and I said no, I’m not going to sell The Gambia and I will not take over this country. I am not elected by the people and I am doing my job. I assured them that by the grace of God, Adama Barrow will take over but they doubted me,” General Bargie said. Asked to give names of the nations or people who offered him money to topple Jammeh, Bargie said: “It is confidential. You are the second journalist to ask me this. But confidential things should be kept confidential. These are not issues that have to be brought out for the world, because if it is gone public that country is going to be shamed and I don’t want to expose anybody or any country. Well, they are both African and Western countries (laughs). You are pushing me to point at a particular direction.’’ General Bargie went on to disclose that at the beginning, he was offered 75 million euros and later he received an offer of 250 million dollars. “There was another offer. The last one which even annoyed me because it was a lot of money. But I will not repeat what I said to them because Allah will punish me. I was out of my mind and annoyed by the fact that another country will ask me to sell my country. That was how I was feeling. It would have been blood money, I swear to God that is not me. I will not use blood money,” he said.",

    "description":"Businessman Amadou Samba has described former President Yahya Jammeh as a mad dictator, adding that he had no business relations with him. Appearing for the third time before the Janneh Commission yesterday, Samba said: “I did not achieve my success through Jammeh. I was already a successful businessman as evidenced by the fact that I was awarded businessman of the year in 1992, well before Jammeh came to power. The jobs I created are many and the tax I have paid is in billions. The records are there to prove that. I am a lawyer by profession but because I had temptation for money, I decided to go into business”. Mr Samba said Jammeh was a dictator and a bad man with whom he had no business relations. Reacting to the testimony of Lang Conteh on the sale of Kairaba Beach Hotel, Samba denied having conversation with Jammeh, Baba Jobe and Lang Conteh regarding the sale of the hotel, describing Mr Conteh as a “pathological liar.” “I have nothing to do with Lang Conteh or Baba Jobe and there was no occasion where I sat with Lang Conteh, Baba Jobe and the ex-President to discuss the issue of Kairaba Hotel. Mr Baba Jobe appointed me as chairman which was even symbolic and I have nothing to do with Kairaba except when Mr Robert Aswandi contacted me on the sale of Kairaba,” Mr Samba said. He said the only encounter he had with Lang Conteh was when Mr Conteh contacted him for the acquisition of Sun Beach Hotel and told him he was going to offer him $3,000,000 but he just laughed because he knew that Mr Conteh was going to take that money from CBG since he was the nerve centre of the bank and even overshadowed the governor. “I have never dealt with Mr Conteh when he was director of foreign exchange at the central bank,” he added. Samba informed Commissioners that he introduced the late Baba Jobe to Peter Smith and that could be the reason of Baba appointing him as Chairman of the Hotel. “From the beginning, I knew that everything about the hotel was meant for ex-President Jammeh because after all, Baba was working for Yahya Jammeh and at the time Baba appointed me, he was the de facto operator.” He denied any involvement in the acquisition of properties by the former president, saying he only acted as a middle man and negotiated prices for him and has no vested interest in Jammeh’s properties. “I wouldn’t agree with Pa Harry Jammeh on the acquisition of the former president’s properties because my only role was to negotiate the prices for him and Jammeh will always counter offer and ask me to send those selling their properties to his lawyer and the money for the purchase is usually delivered to his solicitor. I have never attended and would never attend auction sales at the Sheriff Division on behalf of Jammeh. I was just acting like a middle man for the ex-president and I would not call that a representation for the former president,” Mr Samba said. He said he voluntarily submitted 47 properties acquired by the former president to the investigators in the name of Kanilai Family Farm and KGI. Sittings continue next week. ",
